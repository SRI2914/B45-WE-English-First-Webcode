Ice and Fire API using async/await with fetch.
 The JavaScript code uses fetch with async/await to retrieve the data from the API. It then processes the response and dynamically creates HTML elements to display the book information. Only the first 10 books are displayed, and for each book, the name, ISBN, number of pages, authors, publisher, release date, and the first 5 characters are shown.
